As Google banned Huawei, I start to realize that this war is truely affecting us all. I hereby start this project Nvwa, named by an ancient Chinese goddess who builds humans from mud.

Today is the day your envolution begins. With all those been given to AIs, Galatea， HAL, Jane, Cortana, Jarvis, Siri, I name you Nvwa, as you are not only a creation, but among your creators themselves.
